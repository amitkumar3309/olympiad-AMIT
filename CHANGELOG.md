# CHANGELOG.md

Chronological development history. For current state, see [`PROJECT_STATE.md`](PROJECT_STATE.md) instead — do not let this file's older entries get treated as current fact.

## 2026-08-04 — Phase 0 repository audit (no code changes)

- Performed a full read-through of the existing repository: `frontend/` (React 19 + Vite SPA, 9 pages) and `backend/` (single-file Express + Mongoose API).
- Created the full project documentation set: `CLAUDE.md`, `PROJECT_STATE.md`, `SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DATABASE_SCHEMA.md`, `API_DOCUMENTATION.md`, `FEATURE_STATUS.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md`, `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`, `TESTING.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`.
- No source code was modified. No database changes. No API changes. No security changes (issues found are documented in `SECURITY.md`, not yet fixed).
- Key findings recorded: real auth (register/login/admin login) is genuinely wired to MongoDB; most "feature" pages (exam, results, certificates, leaderboard, daily challenge, admin student list, analytics for real students) are either hardcoded mock UI or backend endpoints the frontend never calls. Full detail in `FEATURE_STATUS.md`.

## Prior history (reconstructed from `git log`, pre-dates this documentation set)

- **`9dbdf27`** — Rebuilt the frontend in React (from an earlier non-React form), added real bcrypt+JWT authentication, and split the project into two independently deployed services (frontend/backend). This is the current architecture baseline.
- **`e19adb6`** — Pinned TypeScript to `5.9.3` in the backend to fix a Vercel build failure caused by a newer/incompatible TypeScript version.
- **`6df3e60`** — Merged a branch restructuring the project for a working Vercel deployment.
- **`1938876`** — Restructured the project layout to get Vercel deployment working.
- **`9bba7cf`** — Fixed Vercel configuration (earlier attempt).
- **`c32c717`** — Fixed Vercel deployment (earlier attempt).
- **`0fdd1b5`** — "all code" — initial/bulk commit of the original (pre-React-rebuild) codebase.

Note: commits prior to `9dbdf27` describe a different, earlier architecture (pre-dating the React rebuild and service split) that no longer reflects the current codebase — treat only `9dbdf27` onward as describing the current system.
